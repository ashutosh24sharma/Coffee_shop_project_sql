# COFFEE SHOP SALES PROJECT

This project performs end-to-end sales analysis for a coffee shop chain using SQL ( SQL Server). I ingested raw CSV sales data, cleaned and transformed it, built analytical tables and views, and calculated business KPIs to support dashboards and decision-making. The analysis covers transaction-level metrics, product and category performance, regional trends, and time-series insights.
